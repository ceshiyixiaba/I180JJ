## Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before

Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.

### …or create a new repository on the command line

```shell
echo "# I180JJ" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/ceshiyixiaba/I180JJ.git
git push -u origin master
```

### …or push an existing repository from the command line

```shell
git remote add origin https://github.com/ceshiyixiaba/I180JJ.git
git push -u origin master
```

### …or import code from another repository

You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
```
